You need branch bug24527 of the Java client.

Ensure you have a working rabbitmq-server dir that is a peer to
rabbitmq-java-client. Do not start rabbitmq-server. Run:

$ sh ./build/dist/runjava.sh com.rabbitmq.examples.perf.PerformanceMain

wait patiently, and copy the results.js file that it spits out into
this directory.

Chrome users may need to view the page via a web server, not file://.

$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

will do in a pinch.
